SwitchVpn is a portable program for running VPN proxies on Windows x64. It operates in the system tray, displaying IP and location. You can quickly switch between VPN proxies from the menu: Opera, Hola, Windscribe, and Dump. You can set "Bind-Address" as the system proxy at startup, or manually via the menu. Program allows specifying additional startup parameters for the proxy and save it for next start.
